The calculation Calculation Program in Python allows users to determine a future calculation based
on an initial calculation input and a specified duration to be added. Users begin by entering
 the initial calculation, clearly indicating whether it is in AM or PM format. Following this,
  they provide the number of hours and minutes to be added. The final step involves
  inputting the starting date to anchor the calculation. This program is particularly
   useful for scheduling and calculation management, ensuring precise future calculation projections.`;
